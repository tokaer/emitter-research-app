# GHG Protocol Scope Categories Reference

This document defines the scope categories used in greenhouse gas accounting according to the GHG Protocol.

## Scope Context for Emission Factor Selection

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions
Emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organization. Typically involves **combustion processes** of fossil fuels.

**Search context**: When Scope 1 is specified, prioritize datasets related to:
- Combustion processes (e.g., "burned in building", "burned in industrial furnace")
- Direct fuel use (diesel, natural gas, petrol, coal)
- On-site energy generation
- Process emissions from manufacturing

### Scope 2: Indirect Energy Emissions
Emissions from purchased energy (electricity, heat, steam, cooling).

**Search context**: When Scope 2 is specified, prioritize datasets related to:
- Electricity production and supply
- District heating/cooling
- Steam generation
- Energy transmission and distribution

### Scope 3: Other Indirect Emissions
Emissions from the value chain, including **production and manufacturing** of products, materials, and services.

**Search context**: When Scope 3 is specified, prioritize datasets related to:
- Cradle-to-gate production processes
- Manufacturing and processing
- Material extraction and production
- Transportation and logistics
- End-of-life treatment

## Usage Guidelines for LLM Candidate Selection

1. **Scope 1 Combustion Priority**: When Scope 1 is indicated, strongly prefer datasets containing "burned", "combustion", "in building", "in industrial furnace", "in boiler"

2. **Scope 3 Production Priority**: When Scope 3 is indicated, strongly prefer "production", "manufacturing", "at plant", cradle-to-gate processes

3. **Category Context**: Use the category and subcategory to narrow down the material/process type (e.g., 3.1.4 Metalle → search for metal production datasets)

4. **Market vs. Production**: Scope 3 typically requires production processes; market datasets should be avoided unless explicitly needed

5. **Geographic Specificity**: Match region preferences based on the input region field (e.g., RER, GLO, DE)
